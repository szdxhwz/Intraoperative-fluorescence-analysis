In this study, video de-dithering and image alignment were used for preprocessing, then fluorescence intensity was extracted through the hue, saturation, and lightness (HSV) color space and a biophysical model was fitted using the RANSAC algorithm and nonlinear least squares, and finally machine learning was used for evaluation. Simultaneous frame fetching, alignment and fitting are done in a multi-threaded or multi-process approach, which greatly improves the computational speed.
